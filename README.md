# Jetbrains Academy Project: Key Terms Extraction

About  
Extracting keywords can help you get to the text meaning. Also, It can help you with splitting texts into different categories. In this project, you will learn how to extract relevant words from a collection of news stories. There are many different ways to do it, but we will focus on frequencies, part-of-speech search, and TF-IDF methods. Note that each method can yield the results with varying degrees of accuracy for different texts. In reality, it is always good to try various methods and choose the best.

What you'll do and what you'll learn:  
Stage 1/4: Most frequent words  
Read a file containing news articles, lowercase the text, tokenize it with the NLTK tokenizer's help, and create a token frequency list.

Stage 2/4: Most frequent words  
Improve the results by applying lemmatization and deleting stop-words, digits, and punctuation. 

Stage 3/4: Most frequent words  
Discover how to use part-of-speech tagging to extract the most frequent nouns and refine your keywords.

Stage 4/4: Most frequent words  
Find out how to identify words with the highest TF-IDF score.
