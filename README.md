# Jetbrains Academy Project: Key Terms Extraction

## **About**  
Extracting keywords can help you get to the text meaning. Also, It can help you with splitting texts into different categories. In this project, you will learn how to extract relevant words from a collection of news stories. There are many different ways to do it, but we will focus on frequencies, part-of-speech search, and TF-IDF methods. Note that each method can yield the results with varying degrees of accuracy for different texts. In reality, it is always good to try various methods and choose the best.  
## **Learning outcomes**  
By completing this project, you will get to know and implement crucial text preprocessing stages, tokenization and lemmatization, useÂ NLTK, an essential NLP library, work with XML files, and program maths formulas! Along the way, you will create a useful tool and learn how to handle reading and writing files with confidence.
## **What you'll do and what you'll learn:**  
- [Stage 1/4: Most frequent words](https://hyperskill.org/projects/166/stages/860/implement)
Read a file containing news articles, lowercase the text, tokenize it with the NLTK tokenizer's help, and create a token frequency list.

- [Stage 2/4: Most frequent words](https://hyperskill.org/projects/166/stages/861/implement) 
Improve the results by applying lemmatization and deleting stop-words, digits, and punctuation. 

- [Stage 3/4: Most frequent words](https://hyperskill.org/projects/166/stages/862/implement)
Discover how to use part-of-speech tagging to extract the most frequent nouns and refine your keywords.

- [Stage 4/4: Most frequent words](https://hyperskill.org/projects/166/stages/863/implement) 
Find out how to identify words with the highest TF-IDF score.
